# Linear Regression Model Implementation in Python

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a **Linear Regression model** in Python.  
The experiment demonstrates how a simple machine learning model is trained to find a relationship between input (X) and output (Y) values.

## Theory

### What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that models a relationship between:
- **Independent variable (X)**  
- **Dependent variable (Y)**  

It fits a straight line to the data using the equation:

\[
Y = mX + c
\]

Where:
- **m** = slope  
- **c** = intercept  

The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the error using **Least Squares Method**.

### Why Linear Regression?
- Easy to implement  
- Useful for prediction and trend analysis  
- Foundation for advanced ML algorithms

## Steps Performed in the Experiment
1. Import Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn)  
2. Load dataset  
3. Preprocess data  
4. Train Linear Regression model  
5. Predict output values  
6. Plot scatter data and best-fit line  
7. Show results (m, c, accuracy score, graph)
